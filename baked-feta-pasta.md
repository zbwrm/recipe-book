This recipe is most notable for being incredibly tasty & simple -- it really only has ~3 real steps to making it. 
Thoughts / steps to adding protein to this recipe is left as an exercise for the reader. 

**NOTE: A must have for this recipe is a casserol tray/pan that can stand high heat in the oven (a dutch oven will do the trick too).**
### Ingredients

- *1 lb cherry tomatoes*
- *4-5 cloves garlic halved*
- *8 oz Block of Greek (sheep's milk) feta*
- *1/3 to 1/2 cup olive oil*
- *8-12 oz of pasta (reserve some pasta water after boiling)*
- *1 bunch of fresh basil*
- *~1/2 tsp chili flakes (add more to taste)*
- *salt & black pepper* 

### Procedure
#### Prep

- *Preheat oven to 400 &deg;F*
- *Lightly drizzle olive oil onto pan, placing whole block of feta in the center. Drizzle more olive oil over the block, adding chili flakes and some salt & pepper to the top of the feta.*
- *Fill the rest of the tray with tomatoes & halved garlic cloves, drizzle with remaining olive oil. Stir tomatoes around to ensure oil covers all tomatoes & garlic.*

#### Time-sensitive

1. *Once oven reaches temperature, add pan into oven, setting a timer for 40 minutes.*
2. *When the timer has only 10 minutes left, begin boiling pasta. Once noodles are cooked, strain them saving ~1 cup of pasta for sauce thickening.*
3. *Once timer reaches 40 mintutes, take pan out of oven. Tear / cut basil into rough pieces and add to pan. Stir contents of pan together until it becomes roughly homogenous.*
4. *Add pasta to sauce, mixing together in the tray. Add pasta water to thicken as needed. Add salt & pepper to taste.*
