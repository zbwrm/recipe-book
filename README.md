## [Recipe Name]
*Any notes go here. How many does it serve?*
### Ingredients
*Ingredients listed by a measurable or eyeball-able quantity.*
- *3 large garlic cloves.*
- *200 g whole-wheat flour.*
- *Pinch of cumin.*

### Procedure
#### Prep
*Cutting, soaking, etc. all go here. If it can reasonably be done ahead of time,
it's prep.*
#### Time-sensitive
*The moment-to-moment cooking procedure. Include timings or cooking conditions
where relevant:*
- *Cook chicken in the oven for 15 minutes.*
- *Saute beef cubes until browned.*

*These should be in the appropriate cooking sequence. If there are two parallel
cooking procedures (i.e. sauce-making at the same time pasta cooks) I suggest
you clearly note where the procedures intersect:*
1. *Cook pasta until just shy of al dente. (Until task 3.)*
2. *Prepare sauce.*
3. *(Requires task 1.) Add sauce to pasta.*

*If it gets really complicated, a flowchart might be nice.*
